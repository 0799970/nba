# NBA API

As far as I can tell, the NBA's stats API does not have public documentation. As such, it's unclear what the acceptable values are for certain query parameters. Most of what's in here is based on inspecting the parameters [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com/) uses in its own requests. I also took some pointers from the source of [this repo](https://github.com/Caged/nba-player-tracking). Suggestions on a more comprehensive approach, or contributions, are extremely welcome.

I also couldn't find anything on the terms of use. If you know of a relevant policy, please point me to it.
